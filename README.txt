This is a project that was created to show a basic understanding of RSA encryption. It is not cryptographically secure.
DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN DEMONSTRATIVE PURPOSES!

To generate keys, run "generate_keys.cpp" and follow the instructions in-program. The outputs will be "Public Key.txt" and "Private Key.txt".

To encrypt, enter a number in "Plaintext.txt", run "encrypt.cpp" and follow the instructions in-program. The output is "Ciphertext.txt".

To decrypt, enter a number in "Ciphertext.txt", run "decrypt.cpp" and follow the instructions in-program. The output is "Plaintext.txt".
